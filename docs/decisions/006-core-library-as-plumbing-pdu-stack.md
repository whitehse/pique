# ADR 006: Core Library as Plumbing — PDU Parsing with Unencapsulated Data Exposure

**Date**: 2026-06-27  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Deciders**: Project maintainers

## Context
The project follows the "plumbing" philosophy from the start (see ARCHITECTURE.md and user memory). However, it is important to explicitly record the decision so that future extensions (binary row decoding, PostGIS type handling, extended query protocol, etc.) do not accidentally introduce active behavior.

## Decision
The core library (`pqwire`) shall act strictly as **plumbing**.

### Key Principles

1. **Minimal Active Code**
   - The library should contain as little "active" logic as possible.
   - It is an expert at **parsing and serializing Protocol Data Units (PDUs)** — StartupMessage, Authentication*, Query, Parse/Bind/Execute, RowDescription, DataRow (text/binary), etc.
   - It does **not** decide what to do with the data (no auto-auth responses, no auto-ReadyForQuery, no query execution).

2. **Unencapsulated Data Exposure**
   - Parsed data is returned to the caller in its **unencapsulated form** (complete messages, column metadata with OIDs, raw binary row payloads, PostGIS WKB/EWKB when binary format is used).
   - The library exposes higher-level transmitted content without requiring the caller to understand every framing detail.

3. **Event-Driven Return of Data**
   - Instead of the library performing actions, it **emits** structured data to the caller via `pqwire_next_event` + `protocol_event_t`.
   - The calling application is responsible for acting on this data (e.g., decoding PostGIS geometry, executing queries, handling authentication).

4. **Networking Stack Model**
   - The library behaves like a protocol layer in a stack.
   - PostgreSQL wire data is reduced to raw application payloads + type metadata.
   - A higher-level library or the application itself consumes this data without deep knowledge of the wire format.

5. **Caller Owns All Policy and Side Effects**
   - All networking I/O, authentication policy, query planning, PostGIS decoding, file operations, and decision-making live exclusively in the calling application.
   - The library only transforms bytes ↔ structured protocol data.

## Rationale
- Maximizes reusability and testability (dialectic tests become trivial buffer shuttles).
- Allows the same core PDU parser to be used by many different applications (raw clients, ORMs, proxies, fuzzers).
- Prevents the core from accumulating domain-specific behavior.
- Aligns with the explicit `protocol_event_t` preference and the "core as plumbing" mandate already recorded in project memory.

## Consequences
- New APIs must favor returning parsed data structures or events rather than internally generating responses.
- Binary row handling must emit raw payloads + OID metadata; actual type decoding (including PostGIS) stays outside the core.
- Documentation and examples must clearly show the separation between the protocol library and the application layer.

## Verification
- Code reviews will check that new functionality stays within PDU parsing/serialization boundaries.
- Dialectic tests continue to demonstrate that two protocol contexts can exchange data purely through buffer handoff.

This decision elevates the "pure state machine" principle into a full **networking stack philosophy** and is considered foundational for libpqwire.
